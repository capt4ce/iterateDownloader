# iterateDownloader
 simple python script to download files from a list. It's even more handy when you want to download a list of file from a site where they just provide a base file name but all the files have the same base URL.

execution example:
python iterateDownloader.py dowonload.list "http://traffic.libsyn.com/effortlessenglish/"
